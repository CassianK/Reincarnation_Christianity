<h2><strong>Part 1. Basic Structure Analysis</strong></h2>

<h3>1.1 Body Palace (身宮) Interpretation: Soul's Behavioral Instincts</h3>

<p>🎯 <strong>Meaning of Body Palace</strong>
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, the Body Palace represents the 'behavioral instincts' of this lifetime, or 'how past life karma manifests in the present life.' While the Life Palace asks "Who am I?", the Body Palace shows <strong>"What do I repeat?"</strong></p>

<h4>📍 <strong>Basic Configuration</strong></h4>

<p>| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| <strong>Body Palace Location</strong> | Wealth Palace (財帛宮) |
| <strong>Main Star</strong> | Tian Ji Star (天機星) |
| <strong>Core Meaning</strong> | Past life karma deeply related to wealth, information, strategy, and judgment |</p>

<h4>🔍 <strong>Detailed Interpretation</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Wealth Palace + Tian Ji Star Combination:</strong>
- <strong>Wealth Palace</strong>: Value, assets, means of survival, exchange, circulation structure
- <strong>Tian Ji Star</strong>: Wisdom, calculation, sensitivity, strategy, rotating consciousness
- <strong>Synthesis</strong>: Memory of one who lived by exchanging information, selling judgment, and surviving through strategy in past lives becomes instinctive habit in this life</p>

<h4>💭 <strong>Past Life Traces (Karma)</strong></h4>

<p>You likely played the following roles in past lives:</p>

<ul>
<li>📜 <strong>Strategist (策士)</strong> - Advisor to kings or power holders</li>
<li>🔄 <strong>Information Broker</strong> - Role in distributing knowledge and information</li>
<li>🧠 <strong>Wise Survivor</strong> - One who navigated crises through intuition and judgment</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Change-Reading Planner</strong> - One who grasped flows and formulated strategies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Rather than earning money directly, you were likely positioned behind those who moved through information. A strategist whispering in the king's ear, or 'one who doesn't step forward but leads the overall flow.'</p>

<h4>⚡ <strong>Instinctive Patterns Projected into Present Life</strong></h4>

<p>| Instinctive Pattern | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| <strong>Judgment Addiction</strong> | Before starting anything, must first simulate and process mentally |
| <strong>Stability Seeking</strong> | Prioritizes numbers over emotions, structure over atmosphere |
| <strong>Quick Perception</strong> | Though silent, already sees through others' logic and direction |
| <strong>Emotional Distance</strong> | Strategy and judgment become life's basic language, slowing emotional awareness |</p>

<hr />

<h3>1.2 Core Triangular Structure: Past Life-Present Life-Future Life</h3>

<p>🔺 <strong>3-Axis Structure of Soul Evolution</strong></p>

<p>| Role | Corresponding Palace | Corresponding Star | Meaning |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| <strong>Past Life Emotional Memory</strong> | Fortune Palace (福德宮) | Tan Lang Star (貪狼星) | Echoes of desire, art, sensation |
| <strong>Present Life Self-Center</strong> | Life Palace (命宮) | Tian Xiang Star (天相星) | Balance, morality, refined ethics |
| <strong>Future Life Projection</strong> | Body Palace (身宮) | Tian Ji Star (天機星) | Wisdom, information, judgment |</p>

<h4>📖 <strong>Detailed Analysis by Stage</strong></h4>

<p><strong>🌙 1. Fortune Palace - Tan Lang: Past Life Echoes, Memory of Sensation</strong>
- Seat where past life emotional reverberations remain
- Tan Lang represents sensation and pleasure, artistry and love, and desire itself
- In past lives, you were a being who indulged in emotions, fell in love, and collided with desires
- <strong>Keywords</strong>: Incomplete emotions, artistic life, love's frustration or obsession</p>

<p><strong>☀️ 2. Life Palace - Tian Xiang: Present Life Central Structure, Task of Dignity and Balance</strong>
- Born under the star of balance to refine and harmonize past life's sensual vibrations in present life
- Tian Xiang means 'harmonizer,' 'mediator,' 'fair leader'
- Because of past life's emotional excess, this life is a training ground for the virtue of "balance"
- <strong>Keywords</strong>: Morality, prudence, harmony, dignity, composure</p>

<p><strong>🌟 3. Body Palace - Tian Ji: Seed Toward Next Life, Future of Wisdom and Judgment</strong>
- Tian Ji handles information, thinks strategically, and recognizes circulation
- Destined to be born as one who reads structure through wisdom and designs flow in next life
- Transformation from emotion and ethics to <strong>"one who controls flow through judgment"</strong>
- <strong>Keywords</strong>: Strategy, rotation, neural sensitivity, judgment center</p>

<hr />

<h2><strong>Part 2. Past Life Karma and Relationships</strong></h2>

<h3>2.1 Past Life Relationship Analysis: Incomplete Love</h3>

<p>🔗 <strong>Special Structure: Mystery of Identity</strong></p>

<p>| Palace | Main Star | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| <strong>Spouse Palace (夫妻宮)</strong> | Tan Lang Star (貪狼星) | Present life spouse/partner relationship |
| <strong>Fortune Palace (福德宮)</strong> | Tan Lang Star (貪狼星) | Past life mental/emotional memory |</p>

<p>This combination clearly reveals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A karmic connection deeply intertwined through love or desire in past lives returns in this life as spouse or strong emotional partner.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>💫 <strong>Nature of Past Life Connection</strong></h4>

<p><strong>🎨 Interpretation ① Past life connection was love, or obsession called love</strong>
- Intensely entangled artistically and emotionally with someone in past life
- Could have been lovers, unrequited love, or suppressed sexual emotions
- <strong>Emotions left incomplete and unfinished</strong></p>

<p><strong>🔄 Interpretation ② That connection reappears in this life</strong>
- Appears as spouse or specific partner
- Characteristics: Intense emotional exchange, sexual tension, and repetitive conflicts
- Not simple romance, but <strong>"relationship that shakes and is shaken"</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>2.2 Karmic Relationship Patterns</h3>

<h4>🎭 <strong>Karmic Structure Analysis</strong></h4>

<p>| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| <strong>Nature of Past Life Connection</strong> | Desire, beauty, emotional over-investment |
| <strong>This Life's Task</strong> | Completion or resolution |
| <strong>Repeating Pattern</strong> | Emotional rise → Strong immersion → Separation or addiction |
| <strong>Ultimate Path</strong> | Reconstructing relationships as resonance not indulgence, communion not possession |</p>

<h4>🌊 <strong>Characteristics Appearing in Relationships</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intense First Meeting</strong>: Mysteriously familiar feeling despite first encounter</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Amplitude</strong>: Extreme alternation between love and hate, attraction and repulsion</li>
<li><strong>Longing for Completion</strong>: Illusion that something will be complete with this person</li>
<li><strong>Repetitive Conflicts</strong>: Continuously clashing over similar issues</li>
<li><strong>Unable to Let Go</strong>: Difficult to release emotionally despite rational knowledge it's wrong</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>Part 3. Soul's Evolution Process</strong></h2>

<h3>3.1 Body Palace Energy Flow: 5-Palace Circulation</h3>

<p>🌊 <strong>What is Body Palace Flow?</strong></p>

<p>The Body Palace is the projection axis of energy I unconsciously repeat. This energy starts from one palace, flows to the next, forming a structural rhythm that continues as <strong>"past life habits → present life conditions → next life seeds."</strong></p>

<h4>🔄 <strong>5-Palace Circulation Flow</strong></h4>

<p><code>
Wealth Palace → Health Palace → Travel Palace → Servant Palace → Career Palace
</code></p>

<h4>📋 <strong>Meaning and Tasks of Each Stage</strong></h4>

<p><strong>1️⃣ Wealth Palace (財帛宮): Destiny Beginning from Judgment</strong>
- Being who moved within structures of knowledge, calculation, and value exchange in past life
- Given eyes to read world's flow, but formed instinct to distance from emotions</p>

<p><strong>2️⃣ Health Palace (疾厄宮): Life Learning to Harmonize Body and Mind Rhythms</strong>
- Mid-life manifests as mental-physical exhaustion, emotional fatigue, burnout
- Past life habit of living through knowledge can overwork this life's 'body'
- <strong>Task</strong>: Must learn "slow breathing," "inner rhythm" recovery</p>

<p><strong>3️⃣ Travel Palace (遷移宮): Strategic Transition to External World</strong>
- After organizing inner self, precisely designs and moves external environment
- Creates life structure in own way
- Strengthens execution and mobility, defines social role in personal manner</p>

<p><strong>4️⃣ Servant Palace (奴僕宮): Emotional Recovery with Colleagues</strong>
- Realizes that while world can be designed through strategic thinking, people cannot be controlled
- <strong>Task</strong>: Relearning "how to be together," "how to walk together," "how to work emotionally"</p>

<p><strong>5️⃣ Career Palace (官祿宮): Completed Structure and Social Legacy</strong>
- Completion of professional karma, nameless contribution, quiet authority
- Not a shining leader, but <strong>becoming the soul of structure</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>3.2 Semiotic Structure of Three-Life Reincarnation</h3>

<p>🔺 <strong>Overall Rhythm of Triangular Sign Structure</strong></p>

<p><code>
    Past Life: Tan Lang (Sensation and Desire)  
        ↘      
       Life Palace: Tian Xiang (Refinement and Dignity)  
        ↘     
       Body Palace: Tian Ji (Wisdom and Judgment)
</code></p>

<h4>🌀 <strong>Meaning of Each Transition Point</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tan Lang → Tian Xiang</strong>: Emotional dissolution → Balance training</li>
<li><strong>Tian Xiang → Tian Ji</strong>: Ethical dignity → Structural wisdom</li>
<li><strong>Overall Structure</strong>: <strong>'Three-life reincarnation sign' transitioning from desire through ethics to wisdom</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>🌟 <strong>Integrated Life Proposition</strong></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You lived incomplete art following desire in past lives, are living refined ethics of dignity in present life, and will become a wise gatekeeper designing flow in future lives.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Part 4. Ba Zi Cross-Verification</strong></h2>

<h3>4.1 Ba Zi Based on Wei Hour</h3>

<h4>📅 <strong>Basic Configuration</strong></h4>

<p>| Pillar | Heavenly Stem | Earthly Branch | Ten Gods (Based on Ren Day) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------------------------|

| <strong>Month</strong> | 癸亥 | Gui-Hai | Direct Officer + Indirect Seal |
| <strong>Day</strong> | 壬寅 | Ren-Yin | — (Day Master) |
| <strong>Hour</strong> | 丁未 | Ding-Wei | Hurting Officer + Indirect Wealth |</p>

<h4>🔥 <strong>Special Meaning of Wei Hour</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Ding Fire Hurting Officer + Wei Earth Indirect Wealth combination:</strong>
- <strong>Ding Fire (Hurting Officer)</strong>: Explosive power of emotional expression and creativity, plus mental sensitivity
- <strong>Wei Earth (Tomb)</strong>: Emotional introversion and thick layers of unconscious

<hr />

<h3>4.2 Integrated Zi Wei Dou Shu-Ming Li Analysis</h3>

<h4>🔗 <strong>Cross-Verification Points</strong></h4>

<p><strong>1️⃣ Emotional Structure Consistency</strong>
- <strong>Zi Wei Dou Shu</strong>: Past life Tan Lang (sensation, desire) → Present life Tian Xiang (dignity)
- <strong>Ba Zi Ming Li</strong>: Ding Fire Hurting Officer (emotional expression) + Ren Water Day Master (vapor structure)</p>

<p><strong>2️⃣ Creative Tendency Confirmation</strong>

<h4>💫 <strong>Final Integrated Interpretation</strong></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Having burned sensation in past lives, you tried to harmonize that sensation into dignity in this life, and Wei hour is the soul's determination to now leave it as words, writing, and emotional structures.</strong></p>
