## **Part 1. Basic Structure Analysis**

### 1.1 Body Palace (身宮) Interpretation: Soul's Behavioral Instincts

🎯 **Meaning of Body Palace**
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, the Body Palace represents the 'behavioral instincts' of this lifetime, or 'how past life karma manifests in the present life.' While the Life Palace asks "Who am I?", the Body Palace shows **"What do I repeat?"**

#### 📍 **Basic Configuration**
| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Body Palace Location** | Wealth Palace (財帛宮) |
| **Main Star** | Tian Ji Star (天機星) |
| **Core Meaning** | Past life karma deeply related to wealth, information, strategy, and judgment |

#### 🔍 **Detailed Interpretation**

**Wealth Palace + Tian Ji Star Combination:**
- **Wealth Palace**: Value, assets, means of survival, exchange, circulation structure
- **Tian Ji Star**: Wisdom, calculation, sensitivity, strategy, rotating consciousness
- **Synthesis**: Memory of one who lived by exchanging information, selling judgment, and surviving through strategy in past lives becomes instinctive habit in this life

#### 💭 **Past Life Traces (Karma)**

You likely played the following roles in past lives:

- 📜 **Strategist (策士)** - Advisor to kings or power holders
- 🔄 **Information Broker** - Role in distributing knowledge and information
- 🧠 **Wise Survivor** - One who navigated crises through intuition and judgment
- 🎯 **Change-Reading Planner** - One who grasped flows and formulated strategies

**Characteristics**: Rather than earning money directly, you were likely positioned behind those who moved through information. A strategist whispering in the king's ear, or 'one who doesn't step forward but leads the overall flow.'

#### ⚡ **Instinctive Patterns Projected into Present Life**

| Instinctive Pattern | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Judgment Addiction** | Before starting anything, must first simulate and process mentally |
| **Stability Seeking** | Prioritizes numbers over emotions, structure over atmosphere |
| **Quick Perception** | Though silent, already sees through others' logic and direction |
| **Emotional Distance** | Strategy and judgment become life's basic language, slowing emotional awareness |

### 3.1 Body Palace Energy Flow: 5-Palace Circulation

🌊 **What is Body Palace Flow?**

The Body Palace is the projection axis of energy I unconsciously repeat. This energy starts from one palace, flows to the next, forming a structural rhythm that continues as **"past life habits → present life conditions → next life seeds."**

```
Wealth Palace → Health Palace → Travel Palace → Servant Palace → Career Palace
